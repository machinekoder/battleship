Qt GameEnabler
==============

Qt GameEnabler provides a simple framework for game developers, enabling the 
use of native OpenGL® ES 2.0 code within a Qt application. Qt GameEnabler does 
not utilise QtOpenGL but overrides Qt's own rendering and replaces it with 
native OpenGL. This enables applications to achieve maximum performance for 
just their own use. An application created with Qt GameEnabler will run on all 
devices supporting OpenGL ES 2.0. In addition, Qt GameEnabler provides a 
lightweight, easy-to-use audio framework with rich features.

The three main parts of Qt GameEnabler are:

1. GE::GameWindow: A QGLWidget-like class which allows the inheriter to use
   real OpenGL ES 2.0 instead of encapsulated QtOpenGL. The window will always
   be full-screen and without any compositing enabled: Everything is rendered
   directly on the screen. This prevents the user from using Qt's UI
   functionality, but other parts of it are still usable. For example, QImage
   can be used for loading GL textures.

2. Audio framework: A set of classes providing a very simple and easy-to-use
   system for loading WAV files as audio buffers and playing them with dynamic
   attributes (speed, volume, and so on). Audio playback is implemented using
   custom mixing and a single instance of QAudioOutput in either pull or push
   mode.

3. QML audio plug-in: QML extension plug-in which uses the audio framework to
   provide simple AudioBuffer, AudioEffect, and AudioMixer elements for use
   with QML

This framework has been tested on Symbian^3, Maemo 5 (Nokia N900),
and MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan (Nokia N9 and Nokia N950). In addition, the framework 
supports desktop platforms with OpenGL ES 2.0 emulation libraries (PowerVR), 
and has been tested on Windows XP and Windows 7.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AudioSource             | An interface from which audio data can be pulled. |
|                         | All of the playing is done via this class in      |
|                         | GE::Audio. Custom audio sources must also be      |

|                         | audio buffer itself is not able to play anything, |
|                         | it only contains the audio data.                  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AudioBufferPlayInstance | A class derived from IAudioSource which points to |
|                         | an AudioBuffer and can provide its audio data via |

|                         | of the items in this list are mixed together when |
|                         | the mixer's pullAudio is called.                  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AudioEffect             | An interface for audio effects, such as echo,     |

Developed with Qt SDK 1.2.

3.1 Required Capabilities
-------------------------

None; The application can be self signed on Symbian.

3.2 Known Issues
----------------

None.


4. Building, installing, and running the application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project contains two examples which demonstrate the use of Qt GameEnabler.
The Qt GameEnabler Test example is a simple application that utilises both the 
OpenGL and the audio features of Qt GameEnabler. The example is located in the 
folder 'examples/qtgameenablertest'.

The Qt GameEnabler QML Audio Test example demonstrates the use of the QML 
audio plug-in. While the application does not utilise OpenGL, the user 
interface is implemented with QML code. The example is located in the folder 
'examples/qtgameenablerqmlaudiotest'.

4.1 Preparations
----------------

Check that you have the latest Qt/Qt SDK installed in the development
environment and on the device.

Note: The Qt GameEnabler Test example application, which utilises OpenGL, can 
be compiled directly on any device with OpenGL ES 2.0 support, for example, 
Maemo or Symbian^3 devices. However, if you wish to compile it on some other 
platform - desktop Windows, for example - you must have external OpenGL ES 2.0 
emulation libraries. With Windows or Linux (32bit) desktop, you can use 
Khronos OpenGL ES 2.0 PC-emulation libraries from www.imgtec.com:
http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdkdownloads/index.asp#GLES2

The Qt GameEnabler QML Audio Test example compiles and runs also on platforms 
without OpenGL ES 2.0 support.

4.2 Using the Qt SDK
--------------------

You can install and run the application on the device by using the Qt SDK.
Open the project in the SDK, set up the correct target (depending on the device
platform), and click the Run button. For more details about this approach,
visit the Qt Getting Started section at Nokia Developer
(http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Getting_started/).

4.3 Symbian device
------------------

Make sure your device is connected to your computer. Locate the .sis
installation file and open it with Ovi Suite. Accept all requests from Ovi
Suite and the device. Note that you can also install the application by copying
the installation file onto your device and opening it with the Symbian File
Manager application.

After the application is installed, locate the application icon from the
application menu and launch the application by tapping the icon.

4.4 Nokia N9 and Nokia N950
---------------------------

Copy the application Debian package onto the device. Locate the file with the
device and run it; this will install the application. Note that you can also
use the terminal application and install the application by typing the command
'dpkg -i <package name>.deb' on the command line. To install the application
using the terminal application, make sure you have the right privileges 
to do so (e.g. root access).

Once the application is installed, locate the application icon from the
application menu and launch the application by tapping the icon.

4.5 Desktop computers
---------------------------

Select a desktop target. Modify the qtgameenabler.pri file's according 
section's GLES2 include and library  paths according to where you have 
installed the GLES Emulation SDK:
   'INCLUDEPATH += /PowerVRSDK/Builds/OGLES2/Include' and
   'LIBS +=  -L/PowerVRSDK/Builds/OGLES2/WindowsPC/Lib' must point to valid
   locations.
